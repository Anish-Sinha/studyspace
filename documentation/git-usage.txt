There are 3 main areas in our git usage cycle whatever you wanna call it.

Master  - this is the supposedly bug free, good copy of our current studyspace. 
          We should never push to master, but rather push to staging and then 
          merge with master once we feel like staging is at a good place.

Staging - this is where we push our new features to. Please push them here. Please.

Local   - on your local make a branch called staging. From this branch, pull from
          the remote and it will pull from staging. From this branch, branch out
          into a new branch named after the feature you are developing. 
          Once you feel the feature is at a good point, you can push this branch
          to the remote, and from there pull the changes into staging. 
          If there is a merge conflict in your feature branch on your local pull
          from staging and then resolve the conflicts, and then push again and 
          make the pull request.
